# Arabic-Melodies-ProjectL Maqamat Classification using AI

**Maqamat Classification AI** is a machine learning project aimed at analyzing and classifying Quranic recitations based on their **maqam** (melodic mode). This project leverages deep learning and audio processing techniques to identify maqamat in recitations.

## Project Overview

This project is based on a dataset of Quranic recitations from a single reciter, sourced from a 30.5-hour YouTube playlist. The audio has been preprocessed and segmented into shorter clips to train and evaluate the model.

## Current Progress

- Initial classification models have been developed.
- Work is ongoing to optimize accuracy and enhance performance.
- 85% accuracy has been achieved

## Stay Tuned

The dataset, models, and results will be shared in the coming weeks. Follow this repository for updates.
